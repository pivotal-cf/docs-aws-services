title: Installing the Service Broker
---

This topic describes how to install the Service Broker for AWS by configuring your AWS account and importing the product file into Ops Manager.


##<a id="prerequisites"></a>Installation Prerequisites
* Pivotal Cloud Foundry version 1.8 or higher
* An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account
* Pivotal MySQL, or an already-created MySQL or PostgreSQL database


##<a id="setup"></a>Step 1: Set Up AWS
Configuring your AWS account to allow the Service Broker for AWS 
to create and manage resources involves several tasks.

1. First, you must (create a new Identity and Access Management user)[create-iam-user]. An IAM user is a
persona with a set of attached permissions that can be used by the person or service interacting with AWS.

### <a id="create-iam-user"></a>Create a New IAM User 

Create a new Identity and Access Management (IAM) user for the PCF cluster in the **AWS IAM** console by following the procedure below. 
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have more than one PCF deployment, you must create an IAM user for each deployment. 
Create a new IAM user in your AWS account (do not use the same IAM user that installed PCF on AWS,
as that user profile has different policy restrictions).</p> 

1. Select **Policies** and click **Create Policy**. 
1. Choose **Create Your Own Policy**. 
1. Enter `PCFInstallationPolicy` for **Policy Name** and `Installation Policy for PCF` for  **Description**. 
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Service Broker for AWS also allows a custom name for the `PCFInstallationPolicy`. 
If you wish to use a custom name, provide it here instead of `PCFInstallationPolicy`. 
Later, during Broker Configuration, you will need to enter this custom name.</p>  
1. Copy the following text into the **Policy Document** section:

            {
                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                "Statement": [
                    {
                        "Action": [
                            "s3:CreateBucket",
                            "s3:DeleteBucket",
                            "s3:PutBucketAcl",
                            "s3:PutBucketLogging",
                            "s3:PutBucketPolicy",
                            "s3:PutBucketTagging",
                            "s3:GetObject",
                            "s3:ListBucket",
                            "iam:CreateAccessKey",
                            "iam:CreateUser",
                            "iam:GetUser",
                            "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
                            "iam:DeleteUser",
                            "iam:DeleteUserPolicy",
                            "iam:ListAccessKeys",
                            "iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies",
                            "iam:ListUserPolicies",
                            "iam:ListPolicies",
                            "iam:PutUserPolicy",
                            "iam:GetPolicy",
                            "iam:GetAccountAuthorizationDetails",
                            "rds:CreateDBCluster",
                            "rds:CreateDBInstance",
                            "rds:DeleteDBCluster",
                            "rds:DeleteDBInstance",
                            "rds:DescribeDBClusters",
                            "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                            "rds:DescribeDBSnapshots",
                            "rds:DeleteDBSnapshot",
                            "rds:CreateDBParameterGroup",
                            "rds:ModifyDBParameterGroup",
                            "rds:DeleteDBParameterGroup",
                            "dynamodb:ListTables",
                            "dynamodb:DeleteTable",
                            "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
                            "sqs:CreateQueue",
                            "sqs:DeleteQueue"
                        ],
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Resource": "*"
                    }
                ]
            }
1. Click **Validate Policy** to check for errors. 
1. Click **Create Policy**. This creates an AWS policy that you must apply to every IAM user you create for the Service Broker for AWS. 
1. For each IAM user, click the user name > **Permissions** tab > **Attach Policy** and select **PCFInstallationPolicy**. 
1. Record the **AWS Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** for each of your PCF IAM accounts for later use.


### <a id="emr-policy"></a>Set Up EMR Policy 
Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) is a managed cluster platform for AWS that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, to process and analyze vast amounts of data. The PCF EMR Service Broker enables users to provision and manage an Amazon EMR cluster.

Prerequisite: You must first create your AWS IAM user before you can configure the EMR policy. 
For information about creating your AWS IAM user, see [Set Up AWS](#setup), above.

EMR requires that the **AmazonElasticMapReduceFullAccess** policy be attached to the service broker's IAM user. 
Follow these steps to attach the policy to the user:

1. View your IAM users. Locate the IAM user that you created in [Set Up AWS](#setup), above.
1. In the user summary page, click **Add Permissions**.
1. Select **Attach existing policies directly**.
1. Find **AmazonElasticMapReduceFullAccess** and attach it to the user.


#### <a id="create-roles"></a>Create Roles (EMR Only)
EMR requires two roles in order to provision a cluster:

+ an EMR service role
+ an EMR EC2 instance profile

By default, the AWS Broker uses `PCF_EMR_Service_Role` and `PCF_EMR_EC2_Instance_Profile`. You need to create these roles and attach the necessary AWS managed policies.

**Create the EMR Service Role (Required)**

1. In the IAM Console, select **Roles** and click **Create Role**.
1. In the **Select type of trusted entity** section, click **AWS service.**
1. In the **Choose the service that will use this role** section, click **EMR**. 
1. In the **Select your use case** section, click **EMR**, which is followed by the description "Allows Elastic MapReduce to call AWS services such as EC2 on your behalf."
1. Click **Next:Permissions**.
1. The **Attached permissions policy** page should state that the type of role you selected requires the **AmazonElasticMapReduceRole** policy. Click **Next:Review**.
1. On the Review page, provide a **Role name** and a **Role description**. Pivotal recommends using 
`PCF_EMR_Service_Role` as the name, and 
`EMR Service Role for AWS Broker` as the description.
1. Click **Create role**.

**Create the EMR EC2 Instance Profile (Required)**

1. In the IAM Console, select **Roles** and click **Create Role**.
1. In the **Select type of trusted entity** section, click **AWS service.**
1. In the **Choose the service that will use this role** section, click **EMR**.
1. In the **Select your use case** section, click **EMR Role for EC2**, which is followed by the description "Allows EC2 instances in an Elastic MapReduce cluster to call AWS services such as S3 on your behalf."
1. On the Review page, provide a **Role name** and a **Role description**. Pivotal recommends using
 `PCF_EMR_EC2_Instance_Profile` as the name, and 
 `EMR EC2 Instance Profile for AWS Broker` as the description.
1. After you have created the role, select **Roles**. From the **Role name** list, click `PCF_EMR_EC2_Instance_Profile` or whatever name you used for the role that you just created. On the  **Summary** page for the role, verify that it has an associated **Instance Profile ARN**. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is a string value.

**Create the EMR Auto Scaling Role (Optional)**

EMR also requires an additional role to enable autoscaling: `EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole`.
The role is automatically created for you by AWS (if it does not yet exist) under very specific circumstances. 
It cannot be created in the same way as the previous roles. In order to create it, you must follow the instructions in the relevant section below. 
For more information about the Auto Scaling role, see [Creating the IAM Role for Automatic Scaling](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-automatic-scaling.html#emr-automatic-scaling-iam-role).

Creating this Auto Scaling role requires different manual steps due to limitations within the GO SDK/AWS IAM Role creation console. 
The easiest and quickest way to ensure that `EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole` is set up correctly 
is to create an EMR Cluster through the EMR Console. You can terminate the cluster immediately after the role is created.
In the IAM Console, search for `EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole`. If the role already exists, click it to review summary information.
Verify that the role:

+ has the AWS managed policy called **AmazonElasticMapReduceforAutoScalingRole** attached
+ shows, under the **Trust relationships** tab, that **elasticmapreduce.amazonaws.com** and
**application-autoscaling.amazonaws.com** are recognized as **Trusted entities**.

If the role exists and has these properties, no further configuration is necessary.

If the `EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole` does not exist, perform the follow steps:

1. In the EMR Console, click **Create Cluster**.
1. Select **Go to advanced options**.
1. Click **Next** to accept default settings until **Step 4: Security
Under Permissions**. At this step, select **Custom**.
1. For **Auto Scaling role**, select **Create default role**.
1. Click **Create Cluster**.
1. Check IAM to see that EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole was created.
1. Terminate your cluster.

For more information about creating IAM roles, see [Configure IAM Roles and the Amazon EC2 Instance Profile to Access Other AWS Services](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-iam-roles.html).

###<a id="service_key_policies"></a>Service Key Policies
The Service Broker for AWS allows app developers to create service keys for their service instances. 
Creating a service key creates an IAM user with a templated policy 
and provides the developer with Access Key credentials to the actions listed in the policies below.
For more information on creating service keys, see [Create Service Key](./servicekeys.html#create).

As of v1.1.0, Service Key policy names are configurable. You can choose your own policy name and configure that name in each service by updating the **Service Key Policy Name** field. The default names are used below. 

Create the policy templates for each service that you will enable by logging into the AWS console and doing the following:

1. Select **Policies** and click **Create Policy**. 
1. Choose **Create Your Own Policy**. 
1. Enter `PCFAppDeveloperPolicy-s3` for the **Policy Name** and `Service Broker for AWS Service Key policy for S3` for the **Description**.
1. Enter the following text in the **Policy Document** section, or create your own policy template.

            {
                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                "Statement": [
                    {
                        "Sid": "allowtagging",
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Action": [
                            "s3:GetBucketTagging",
                            "s3:PutBucketTagging"
                        ],
                        "Resource": [
                            "arn:aws:broker:resource::"
                        ]
                     }
                 ]
             }

1. Click **Validate Policy** to check for errors. 
1. Click **Create Policy**. This creates an AWS policy that you must apply to every IAM user you create for the Service Broker for AWS. 
1. Repeat steps 1-6 for `PCFAppDeveloperPolicy-sqs` `PCFAppDeveloperPolicy-dynamodb` `PCFAppDeveloperPolicy-rds` and `PCFAppDeveloperPolicy-emr`, using or modifying the examples below.

<strong>`PCFAppDeveloperPolicy-sqs` Example</strong>

            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:broker:resource::"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

<strong>`PCFAppDeveloperPolicy-dynamodb` Example</strong>

```
{

            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:broker:resource::"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

<strong>`PCFAppDeveloperPolicy-rds` Example</strong>

    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1471636048000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [

                "rds:DescribeDbInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:broker:resource::"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

<strong>`PCFAppDeveloperPolicy-emr` Example</strong>

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "emrServiceKeyActions",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "elasticmapreduce:AddJobFlowSteps",
            "elasticmapreduce:CancelSteps",
            "elasticmapreduce:DescribeCluster",
            "elasticmapreduce:DescribeStep",
            "elasticmapreduce:ListInstances",
            "elasticmapreduce:ListInstanceGroups",
            "elasticmapreduce:ListSteps",
            "elasticmapreduce:ListBootstrapActions",
            "elasticmapreduce:PutAutoScalingPolicy"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "*"
        ]
    }]
}
```

###Bind Key Policies
In v1.5.0 of the AWS Services Broker, EMR setup requires that you specify a Bind Key policy separately from a Service Key policy. 

EMR does not use ARNs for access control, so the `Resource` you use to set up the policy must be `*`.
Because access control is enforced with cluster tagging, Pivotal recommends ensuring that 
applications/service key users do not have permission to modify cluster tags.
The broker will automatically add a condition to the policy that limits access to 
the associated EMR cluster. For more information, see [EMR Cluster Access](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-access-iam.html#emr-fine-grained-cluster-access).

To create the bind key policy template for EMR, log in to the AWS console and follow steps 1 - 6 of [Service Key Policies](#service-key-policies), above, using the following example:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "emrBindActions",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "elasticmapreduce:AddJobFlowSteps",
            "elasticmapreduce:CancelSteps",
            "elasticmapreduce:DescribeCluster",
            "elasticmapreduce:DescribeStep",
            "elasticmapreduce:ListInstances",
            "elasticmapreduce:ListInstanceGroups",
            "elasticmapreduce:ListSteps",
            "elasticmapreduce:ListBootstrapActions",
            "elasticmapreduce:PutAutoScalingPolicy"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "*"
        ]
    }]
}
```


##<a id="create-database"></a>Step 2: Create a Service Broker Database
To store its configuration information, the Service Broker for AWS requires access to a MySQL or PostgreSQL database that is highly available and regularly backed up.
Loss of this data will severely affect the ability of the service broker to manage configured service instances.
However, the AWS resources will not be affected. 

The database can be Pivotal MySQL, an external MySQL, or a PostgreSQL database (including an AWS RDS database). 

If you use a Pivotal MySQL database, the service broker will automatically provision the database. 

If you use an RDS MySQL or RDS PostgreSQL database, follow these steps:

1. In the AWS RDS console, create the appropriate database:
    * Choose the smallest DB instance class, `db.t2.micro`. 
    * Select `yes` for **Multi-AZ Deployment**. 
    * Choose `Provisioned IOPS (SSD)` for **Storage Type**. For a non-production database, you can choose `General Purpose (SSD)`.
    * Enter the minimum accepted value '5' to '100' GB of **Allocated Storage**. 
    * Leave **Provisioned IOPS** at the default value.
    * Enter `pcf-aws-services` for the **DB Instance Identifier**.
    * Enter suitable values for the **Master Username** and **Master Password**.

2. Record the Database IP, Database Port, Admin user, Admin password and Database Name. The Service Broker for AWS stores configuration information in this database. 

3. Ensure that the Service Broker for AWS will be able to connect to your database. If necessary for your deployment, modify your AWS VPC settings to allow access to the RDS database from an external IP address. For more information, see [Accessing a DB Instance in a VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.Scenarios.html) in the AWS documentation.


##<a id="ASGs"></a>Step 3: Create Application Security Groups
To allow this service to have network access, you need to create Application Security Groups (ASGs). ASGs are collections of egress rules that specify the protocols, ports, and IP address ranges where app or task instances send traffic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Without Application Security Groups, the service will not be usable.</p>


### <a id="service-container-network-connections"></a> Service Container Network Connections###
This service is deployed as an application to the `iaas-brokers` space in the
`system` org, and requires the following outbound network connections:

|Destination        |Ports       |Protocol   |Reason
|---                |---         |---        |---
|`AWS_IP_RANGE`     |443, 5432, 1521, 1433, 3306         |tcp        |This service accesses RDS/S3

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The AWS IP range is available from <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html#aws-ip-download">Amazon</a>. You may choose to use <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> and <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> to convert the IP range as downloaded from Amazon into ASG rules:
      </p>

```
    curl -s https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json | \
    jq '[
      {
        ports: "443, 5432, 1521, 1433, 3306",
        protocol: "tcp",
        destination: .prefixes | map(select(.service == "AMAZON")) | .[] | .ip_prefix
      }
    ] | .' > aws-service-broker.json

```

This creates a configuration which allows traffic for all AWS Regions. You may wish to further filter the list of entries in the Application Security Group config to a specific set of AWS Regions by adding additional `jq` `map(select(.region == "REGION_NAME"))` statements for each region.

 Log in as an administrator and create an ASG called `aws-service-broker`, binding it to the `iaas-brokers` space in the `system` org:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-security-group aws-service-broker aws-service-broker.json
$ cf bind-security-group aws-service-broker system iaas-brokers
</pre>


### <a id="application-container-network-connections"></a> Application Container Network Connections ###
Application containers that use instances of this service require the following outbound network connections:

|Destination        |Ports       |Protocol   |Reason
|---                |---         |---        |---
|`AWS_IP_RANGE`     |443, 5432, 1521, 1433, 3306         |tcp        |Application containers may access S3/RDS

Create an ASG called `aws-service-broker-app-containers` with the above configuration and bind it to the appropriate space. To give access to all started apps, use the `default-running` ASG set. For example:

```
[
  {
      "ports": "443, 5432, 1521, 1433, 3306",
      "protocol": "all",
      "destination": "192.0.2.0/14"
  },
  {
      "ports": "443, 5432, 1521, 1433, 3306",
      "protocol": "all",
      "destination": "198.51.100.0/22"
  },
  ...rest of AWS IPs elided...
]
```


##<a id="install"></a>Step 4: Install the Service Broker Tile in Ops Manager
To install the Service Broker for AWS tile in Ops Manager, complete the following steps:

1. Download the Service Broker for AWS product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-service-broker-for-aws).

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product description in the **Available Products** view to add the product to your staging area.

1. Click on the newly added tile to configure the sections as described below.


###<a id="aws-config"></a>AWS Config
The setup in Step 1 must be successfully completed before beginning this configuration. You will need the AWS and database parameters from that step to successfully configure the broker.

1. Select the **AWS Config** side-tab.
    <%= image_tag("aws-sb-awsconfig.png") %>

1. Fill out the fields on the **AWS Config** pane:

###<a id="errands"></a>Errands
Errands are tasks that are needed to support various operations of brokers, or PCF installations. They are scripts that run at designated points during an installation. These can include installation, test, or deletion.
Service Broker for AWS has a deploy errand for deploying the service broker, as well as a remove errand, to remove the broker.

1. Select the **Errands** side-tab.
    <%= image_tag("images/aws-sb-errands.png") %>

1. Fill out the fields on the **Errands** pane:
    <table class="nice">

        <th>Description</th>
        <tr><td><strong>Post-Deploy Errands</strong></td>
                <td>These are tasks that are run after a deployment.<br>
                    Value is set to <code>On</code> by default.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Pre-Deploy Errands</strong></td>
                <td>These are tasks that are run before a deployment.<br>
                    Value is set to <code>On</code> by default.</td>
        </tr>
</table>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> The <b>Deploy Broker</b> and <b>Remove Broker</b> errands are essential for Service Broker for AWS to function.
These configurations should both remain set to their default states of <code>On</code>.
Should these be turned off, unintended behavior may occur.</p>


###<a id="resource-config"></a>Resource Config
Resources define the hardware configurations of the Virtual Machines (VMs) running errands.
These VMs get destroyed when the errand is complete.
This pane allows the user to manage the resource usage of Service Broker for AWS.

###<a id="stemcell"></a>Stemcell
A stemcell is a versioned Operating System image wrapped with IaaS specific packaging.
This is the template from which Ops Manager creates the VMs needed for a wide variety of components and products.
A minimum version is required, and is dependent on your cloud platform (AWS, Azure, vSphere, etc.).

To access and download the stemcell required for your platform, see [Stemcells for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells/)

1. Select the **Stemcell** side-tab.

##<a id="confirm"></a>Step 5: Confirm Installation
Follow the steps below to confirm your Service Broker for AWS installation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Service Broker for AWS installs an app called <code>aws-services-broker</code> in the <code>iaas-brokers</code> space of the <code>system</code> org. Like other CF apps, you can view the application logs via the CF CLI by connecting to that org and space with the correct permissions.</p>

1. After Ops Manager finishes the installation, the **Service Broker for AWS** tile appears on the **Installation Dashboard**.
    <%= image_tag("images/aws-sb-install.png") %>

1. In Apps Manager, all Orgs and Spaces show the new services in the Services Marketplace. 
Users can create instances of these services through Apps Manager or by using the cf CLI. 
Review [Creating and Managing Service Instances](creating.html) for more information.
