## <a id="1-4-18"></a> 1.4.18

**Release Date: July 28, 2021**

### Features
New features and changes in this release:

* Extra binding URI parameters can be configured on MySQL, MariaDB, Aurora, and Postgres plans. These parameters can be used as hints for application DB connectors that aren't properly connecting.

### Resolved Issues
This release fixes the following issue:

* Aurora MySQL 5.7+ instances can be provisioned, as long as you specify "aurora-mysql" as the engine name. AWS changed the name of the aurora engine starting in 5.7 compatible versions.

* Postgres 10+ instances can be provisioned. AWS changed the naming convention of the parameter group family starting in PG10.

* Fixed a bug where SQL server instances can no longer be bound, when the broker is pushed into a TAS with newer golang buildpacks due to changes in go/sql standard libraries.

### Maintenance Changes

Maintenance changes in this release:

* Bump versions of all database driver libraries. These dependencies require a TAS foundation with a golang 1.14+ buildpack. Given that go 1.14 is already out of general support we do not consider this a breaking change.

* Extended End of General Support (EOGS) to February 28, 2022.

###Known Issues
This release has the following issue:
<%= partial "postgresql-role-issue" %>

## <a id="1-4-17"></a> 1.4.17

**Release Date: June 8, 2021**

<p class="note breaking"><strong> Breaking Change:</strong>
Switch to stemcell Xenial 621.x so that you are running on a stemcell
that will be supported in the future.
</p>

### Maintenance Changes

Maintenance changes in this release:

* Extended End of General Support (EOGS) to December 31, 2021.

  including the long-term support (LTS) versions.

## <a id="1-4-16"></a> 1.4.16

### Resolved Issues
This release fixes the following issue:

However, you must not modify the **Engine** field because it is not supported.
