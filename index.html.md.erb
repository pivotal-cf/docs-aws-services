The [<%= vars.product_full %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-service-broker-for-aws) provides
[<%= vars.app_runtime_full %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) users with the ability
to create and manage Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources from the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

##<a id="overview"></a>Overview

The <%= vars.product_short %> is installed once and exposes the selected AWS services in the Marketplace.
App developers can then create and manage a service instance by using the cf CLI commands `create service`,
`bind service`, `unbind service`, and `delete service`.
After obtaining a service key using the `create-service-key` command,
developers can use the key with the AWS CLI to perform additional operations as permitted by their operator.
