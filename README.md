# Service Broker for AWS

## How the branches here work

Use **master** for next the unreleased version, and numbered branches for the corresponding live releases. For example:

| Branch name | Use for… | Currently lives…
|-------------| ------| ------|
| master      | Currently the published 1.4.5 branch | http://docs.pivotal.io/aws-services/ |
| v1.5.x         | Currently edge | https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/aws-services/1-5/ |
| v1.4.x 		| Currently not live (to be created and published after 1.5.x release) | https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/aws-services/1-4/ |

Currently, as seen above, v1.5.x is the edge branch with the latest changes.
Ideally, once 1.5.x is released, it would become the published branch, and master would become the edge branch.
