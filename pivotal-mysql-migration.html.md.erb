### Upgrading to Pivotal's MySQL v2

MySQL for PCF v2 introduces the On-Demand Service, which provides dedicated instances of MySQL that App Developers can provision on-demand from the command line.

This guide will instruct you how to migrate the broker to use this new version of the Pivotal MySQL service.

### Instructions

#### Prerequisites

* The latest Cloud Foundry CLI [available here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli)
* Cloud Foundry credentials to access the org and space of the broker

##### 1. Install the Pivotal MySQL Plugin for the Cloud Foundry CLI

To migrate your data to the new service a plugin for the Cloud Foundry CLI is available.

You can install the plugin using the following commands

```bash
$ cf install-plugin -f -r CF-Community "MysqlTools"
```

You can verify the installation using the following commands

```bash
$ cf mysql-tools -h
```

##### 2. Stop the AWS Services Broker

Login into your Cloud Foundry deployment

```bash
$ cf api $YOUR_CLOUD_FOUNDRY_API
$ cf login
```

The broker is deployed in the `system` org in the `iaas-brokers` space.
Target this space verfiy you see the broker.

```bash
$ cf target -o system -s iaas-brokers
api endpoint:   https://api.sys.my-domain.com
api version:    2.94.0
user:           admin
org:            system
space:          iaas-brokers

$ cf app aws-services-broker
Showing health and status for app aws-services-broker in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...

name:              aws-services-broker
requested state:   started
instances:         2/2
usage:             64M x 2 instances
routes:            aws-services-broker.sys.my-domain.com
last uploaded:     Tue 05 Jun 14:46:50 EDT 2018
stack:             cflinuxfs2
buildpack:         go_buildpack

     state     since                  cpu    memory         disk          details
#0   running   2018-06-05T18:47:39Z   0.0%   12.4M of 64M   47.4M of 1G
#1   running   2018-06-05T18:47:39Z   0.0%   12.5M of 64M   47.4M of 1G
```

Additionally you should see your Pivotal MySQL v1 database instance bound to the broker.

```bash
$ cf services
Getting services in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...

name            service   plan    bound apps            last operation
aws-broker-db   p-mysql   100mb   aws-services-broker   create succeeded
```

Now let's stop the broker

```bash
$ cf stop aws-services-broker
Stopping app aws-services-broker in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...
OK
```

Unbind the database from the broker

```bash
$ cf unbind-service aws-services-broker aws-broker-db
```

##### 3. Use the MySQL Tool Plugin to perform the migration

Determine the plan you want to migrate to

```bash
$ cf marketplace -s p.mysql
Getting service plan information for service p.mysql as admin...
OK

service plan   description                                             free or paid
db-small       This plan provides a small dedicated MySQL instance.    free
db-medium      This plan provides a medium dedicated MySQL instance.   free
db-large       This plan provides a large dedicated MySQL instance.    free
```

For illustrative purposes the instructions will use the plan type `db-small`. Given that our service instance is named `aws-broker-db` then we perform the migration using the following command

```bash
$ cf mysql-tools migrate aws-broker-db db-small
2018/06/06 09:11:53 Creating new service instance "aws-broker-db-new" for service p.mysql using plan db-small
2018/06/06 09:16:05 Unpacking assets for migration to /var/folders/qn/bxc0sm8j5dgcx260_4r3vr7w0000gn/T/migrate_app_335236385
2018/06/06 09:16:05 Started to push app
Done uploading
2018/06/06 09:16:15 Successfully pushed app
2018/06/06 09:16:16 Successfully bound app to v1 instance
2018/06/06 09:16:18 Successfully bound app to v2 instance
2018/06/06 09:16:18 Starting migration app
2018/06/06 09:16:33 Started to run migration task
2018/06/06 09:16:37 Migration completed successfully
```

The migration tool renamed the old database. In our example it would be called `aws-broker-db-old`

```bash
$ cf services
Getting services in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...

name                service   plan       bound apps            last operation
aws-broker-db-old   p-mysql   100mb                            update succeeded
aws-broker-db       p.mysql   db-small                         update succeeded
```

##### 4. Switch the broker's backing store the the new database

Bind our new database to the broker

```bash
$ cf bind-service aws-services-broker aws-broker-db
Binding service aws-broker-db to app aws-services-broker in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...
OK
```

Start the broker

```bash
$ cf start aws-services-broker
Starting app aws-services-broker in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...

Waiting for app to start...

name:              aws-services-broker
requested state:   started
instances:         2/2
usage:             64M x 2 instances
routes:            aws-services-broker.my-domain.com
last uploaded:     Wed 06 Jun 10:23:12 EDT 2018
stack:             cflinuxfs2
buildpack:         go_buildpack
start command:     bin/aws-services-broker

     state     since                  cpu    memory         disk          details
#0   running   2018-06-06T14:26:48Z   0.0%   11.7M of 64M   47.4M of 1G
#1   running   2018-06-06T14:26:49Z   0.0%   11.8M of 64M   47.4M of 1G
```

##### 5. Validate behaviour and cleanup the old database

Prior to deleting the old database instance validate the broker behaves correctly. This can be done by creating some new AWS service instances and deleting them. If everything behaves as normal delete the old database using the following command

```bash
$ cf delete-service -f aws-broker-db-old
Deleting service aws-broker-db-old in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...
OK
```

##### 6. Update the tile to reflect the plan changes

Although we've migrated our database we should update the plan name in the `Broker Config` section to be consistent with what was selected above. Performing this change won't have any effect.
