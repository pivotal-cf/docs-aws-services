title: Migrating to a VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs Database
---

This topic explains how to perform the migration from a MySQL for PCF v1 database to a VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs database.

If your AWS Services Broker is configured to use the MySQL for PCF v1 tile, VMware recommends migrating your data to a VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs database. Doing this migration reduces dependency on v1 as users move to v2, and prepares you to use TLS (encryption) for  AWS services.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

To perform the database migration, you must have the following:

* The latest [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)

* Cloud Foundry credentials to access the org and space of the AWS Services Broker

## <a id="install-mysql-plugin"></a> Install the MysqlTools Plugin

You can use the MysqlTools plugin to migrate your data.

1. Install the `MysqlTools` plugin using the following command:

    ```bash
    cf install-plugin -f -r CF-Community "MysqlTools"
    ```

2. Verify that the plugin is installed using the following command:

    ```bash
    cf mysql-tools -h
    ```

## <a id="check-broker-status"></a> Check the Status of the Broker

1. Log in to your Cloud Foundry deployment:

    ```bash
    cf api $YOUR_CLOUD_FOUNDRY_API
    cf login
    ```

    The broker is deployed in the `system` org in the `iaas-brokers` space.

2. Target this space and verify that you see the broker.

    ```bash
    cf target -o system -s iaas-brokers
    ```

    Expected output:

    <pre class="terminal">
    api endpoint:   https://api.sys.my-domain.com
    api version:    2.94.0
    user:           admin
    org:            system
    space:          iaas-brokers
    </pre>

3. Check the state of the broker by running:

    ```bash
    cf app MY-BROKER-NAME
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf app aws-services-broker

    Showing health and status for app aws-services-broker in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...

    name:              aws-services-broker
    requested state:   started
    instances:         2/2
    usage:             64M x 2 instances
    routes:            aws-services-broker.sys.my-domain.com
    last uploaded:     Tue 05 Jun 14:46:50 EDT 2018
    stack:             cflinuxfs3
    buildpack:         go_buildpack

         state     since                  cpu    memory         disk          details
    #0   running   2018-06-05T18:47:39Z   0.0%   12.4M of 64M   47.4M of 1G
    #1   running   2018-06-05T18:47:39Z   0.0%   12.5M of 64M   47.4M of 1G
    </pre>

1. You should also see your MySQL for PCF v1 database instance bound to the broker.

    ```bash
    cf services
    ```

    Expected output:

    <pre class="terminal">
    Getting services in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...

    name            service   plan    bound apps            last operation
    aws-broker-db   p-mysql   100mb   aws-services-broker   create succeeded
    </pre>

## <a id="stop-broker"></a> Stop the Broker

After verifying the state of the broker, you can safely stop it and unbind the database.

1. Stop the broker:

    ```
    cf stop MY-BROKER-NAME
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf stop aws-services-broker
    Stopping app aws-services-broker in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...
    OK
    </pre>

2. Unbind the database from the broker:

    ```bash
    cf unbind-service MY-BROKER-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf unbind-service aws-services-broker aws-broker-db
    </pre>

## <a id="migrate-data"></a> Migrate Your Data

Follow these steps to migrate your data.

1. Determine which plan you want to use:

    ```bash
    cf marketplace -s p.mysql
    ```

    Expected output:

    <pre class="terminal">
    Getting service plan information for service p.mysql as admin...
    OK

    service plan   description                                             free or paid
    db-small       This plan provides a small dedicated MySQL instance.    free
    db-medium      This plan provides a medium dedicated MySQL instance.   free
    db-large       This plan provides a large dedicated MySQL instance.    free
    </pre>

2. Migrate your data by running:

    ```
    cf mysql-tools migrate SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME PLAN-TYPE
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf mysql-tools migrate aws-broker-db db-small
    2018/06/06 09:11:53 Creating new service instance "aws-broker-db-new" for service p.mysql using plan db-small
    2018/06/06 09:16:05 Unpacking assets for migration to /var/folders/qn/bxc0sm8j5dgcx260_4r3vr7w0000gn/T/migrate_app_335236385
    2018/06/06 09:16:05 Started to push app
    Done uploading
    2018/06/06 09:16:15 Successfully pushed app
    2018/06/06 09:16:16 Successfully bound app to v1 instance
    2018/06/06 09:16:18 Successfully bound app to v2 instance
    2018/06/06 09:16:18 Starting migration app
    2018/06/06 09:16:33 Started to run migration task
    2018/06/06 09:16:37 Migration completed successfully
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Take note of the <code>Migration completed successfully</code> message in the above example.
             This is the best available indication that the migration was successful.
             This message does not appear if the migration process was not successful.</p>

3. List the service instances by running:

    ```
    cf services
    ```

    The migration tool gives the old database the name `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME-old`, for example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...

    name                service   plan       bound apps            last operation
    aws-broker-db-old   p-mysql   100mb                            update succeeded
    aws-broker-db       p.mysql   db-small                         update succeeded
    </pre>

## <a id="bind-new-db"></a> Bind the New Database

After migrating your data, bind the new database to the broker.

1. Bind the new database to the broker:

    ```
    cf bind-service MY-BROKER-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf bind-service aws-services-broker aws-broker-db
    Binding service aws-broker-db to app aws-services-broker in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...
    OK
    </pre>

2. Start the broker:

    ```
    cf start MY-BROKER-NAME
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf start aws-services-broker
    Starting app aws-services-broker in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...

    Waiting for app to start...

    name:              aws-services-broker
    requested state:   started
    instances:         2/2
    usage:             64M x 2 instances
    routes:            aws-services-broker.my-domain.com
    last uploaded:     Wed 06 Jun 10:23:12 EDT 2018
    stack:             cflinuxfs3
    buildpack:         go_buildpack
    start command:     bin/aws-services-broker

         state     since                  cpu    memory         disk          details
    #0   running   2018-06-06T14:26:48Z   0.0%   11.7M of 64M   47.4M of 1G
    #1   running   2018-06-06T14:26:49Z   0.0%   11.8M of 64M   47.4M of 1G
    </pre>

## <a id="delete-old-db"></a> Delete the Old Database

1. Before deleting the old database instance, confirm that the broker behaves
correctly by creating some new AWS service instances.
Try binding these services to the v2 database. (You can delete these service instances after running this test.)

2. After confirming that your data is migrated and the broker is running, delete the old database by running:

    ```
    cf delete-service -f SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME-old
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf delete-service -f aws-broker-db-old
    Deleting service aws-broker-db-old in org system / space iaas-brokers as admin...
    OK
    </pre>

## <a id="update-tile"></a>(Optional) Update the Tile to Reflect Changes

Update the plan name in the `Broker Config` section of your tile to be consistent
with the changes you made during migration.
